/**
 Description
 Given a string s, cut s into some substrings such that every substring is a palindrome.

 Return the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of s.

 s.length <= 2000

 Example 1:
 Input: s = "a"
 Output: 0
 Explanation: "a" is already a palindrome, no need to split.

 Example 2:
 Input: s = "aab"
 Output: 1
 Explanation: Split "aab" once, into "aa" and "b", both palindrome.
