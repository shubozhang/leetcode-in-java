/**
 *
 * Given two sorted integer arrays A and B, merge B into A as one sorted array.
 * You may assume that A has enough space (size that is greater or equal to m + n) to hold additional elements from B.
 * The number of elements initialized in A and B are m and n respectively.
 *
 * Example
 * A = [1, 2, 3, empty, empty], B = [4, 5]
 * After merge, A will be filled as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
 *
 * Tip: compare the elements from end.
