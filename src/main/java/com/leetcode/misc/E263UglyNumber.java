/**
 An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

 Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number.



 Example 1:

 Input: n = 6
 Output: true
 Explanation: 6 = 2 Ã— 3
 Example 2:

 Input: n = 1
 Output: true
 Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3,
 and 5.
 Example 3:

 Input: n = 14
 Output: false
 Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.


 Constraints:

 -231 <= n <= 231 - 1

        n = calUgly(n, 3);
        n = calUgly(n, 5);
