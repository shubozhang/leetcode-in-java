/**
 https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-list/
 Given the head of a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x
 come before nodes greater than or equal to x.

 You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

 Example 1:
 Input: head = [1,4,3,2,5,2], x = 3
 Output: [1,2,2,4,3,5]

 Example 2:
 Input: head = [2,1], x = 2
 Output: [1,2]

 Constraints:
 1) The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 200].
 2) -100 <= Node.val <= 100
 3) -200 <= x <= 200
